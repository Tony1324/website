            <h3>Rendering Human Anatomy in Augmented Reality</h3>
            <p>
                For the past year at Harvard Medical School, I have been developing a system
                with the primary goal of providing intuitive patient education of their anatomy and surgical procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system automatically generates 3D models of organs or tumors from CT or MRI scans, 
                then renders them in augmented reality using the Apple Vision Pro.
