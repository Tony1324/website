            <h3>Rendering Human Anatomy in Augmented Reality</h3>
            <p>
                For the past year at Harvard Medical School, I have been developing a system
                with the primary goal of providing intuitive patient education of their anatomy and surgical procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system automatically generates 3D models of organs or tumors from CT or MRI scans,
                then renders them in augmented reality using the Apple Vision Pro.

            <h3>Fruit Fly Embryogenesis Simulation</h3>
            <p>
                I lead a group of programmers in developing a soft-body physics simulation of the gastrulation process of the Drosophila fruit fly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The JavaScript program simulates a 2D cross-section of the embryo, where each rectangle models a cell.
                After tuning parameters such as stiffness and elasticity and applying appropriate forces, we are able to get results that closely match the real-world process.

            <h3>Raytracer</h3>
            <p>
                A quick project I coded in JavaScript from scratch (including 3d objects and vector calculus) to learn more about the ray-tracing process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program supports materials with different roughness, color, and emmission properties.

            <h3>Character Recognition with Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                A custom neural network to recognize upper and lowercase letters as well as numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a project I worked on with a friend in our freshman year of high school, before LLMs and chatGPT were a thing.
                We both wanted to better understand how neural networks functioned mathematically, so we decided to build one from scratch from arrays and floats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The training was done in python, and the weights were used in JavaScript to create an interactive website.
